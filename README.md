# Aurora_V2

Aurora is a rule-based artificial intelligence system that aims to produce visual art 
outputs (using particle systems and noise field algorithms). These visuals are powered 
by the Internet of Things to use sensors, more specifically, accelerometers to track the 
sequence of movements from its users. This generated data is then transferred to the 
PC using a Wi-Fi module connected to the accelerometers to be processed.
